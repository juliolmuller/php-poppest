![Poppest snapshot](./public/images/app-overview.jpg)

This application was proposed by [Ateliware](https://ateliware.com.br/), as part of their recruitment process for full-stack developer. The challenge was to consume [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/v3/), searching for the 30 most popular repositories for 5 programing languages of my choice, store the results in a database and make this info available through a front-end interface. The use of a backend framework was mandatory. The final app should also be deployed to a public server, like Azure, AWS or Heroku.

[Check out the application running!](https://poppest.herokuapp.com/)

## :hammer: Setting up the Environment

To allow Laravel to use you local configurations like database setup and credentials you will need to rename the file **.env.example** to **.env** and update the values for the `DB_*` variables accordingly. Besides, make sure you have a database created to migrate the schemas and data.

You will also need **Composer** and **Node.js** installed in your machine and their `composer` and `npm` shortcuts available via command line.

To set up your server-side environment, use the following commands:

```bash
$ composer update            # To download PHP dependencies
$ php artisan migrate --seed # To run migrations and seeding
$ php artisan serve          # To start the server
$ composer run test          # To run automated tests
```

When dealing with the front-end, you must use `yarn` to run the scripts:

```bash
$ npm install      # To download JavaScript dependencies
$ npm watch        # To keep compiling to 'public/' while developing
$ npm production   # For minified bundle for production
```
